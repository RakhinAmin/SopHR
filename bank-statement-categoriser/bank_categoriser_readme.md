## File Structure

```
bank-statement-categoriser/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fuzzy_logic_improved.py    # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules.csv                  # Category rules file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bank_statement.csv         # Your bank statement data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ categorized_output.csv     # Generated results (after running)
```

## Input File Formats

### Bank Statement File (CSV)
Your bank statement CSV must contain at least a `Description` column:

```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Balance
2024-01-01,TESCO STORE 1234,25.50,1000.00
2024-01-02,SHELL PETROL STATION,45.00,955.00
2024-01-03,AMAZON PRIME MEMBERSHIP,7.99,947.01
```

**Required columns:**
- `Description`: Transaction description text

**Optional columns:**
- Any additional columns (Date, Amount, Balance, etc.) will be preserved in the output

### Rules File (CSV)
Create a rules file that maps transaction patterns to categories:

```csv
Description,Category
tesco,Groceries
shell,Transport
amazon,Shopping
starbucks,Food & Drink
salary,Income
mortgage,Housing
```

**Required columns:**
- `Description`: Pattern to match against transaction descriptions
- `Category`: Category to assign when pattern matches

## Configuration

### Method 1: Edit Configuration in Code
Modify the `Config` class in `fuzzy_logic_improved.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    bank_statement_file: str = "your_bank_statement.csv"
    rules_file: str = "your_rules.csv"
    output_file: str = "categorized_output.csv"
    match_threshold: int = 70          # Minimum score for categorization
    num_suggestions: int = 3           # Number of suggestions for unmatched
    auto_approve_threshold: int = 80   # Score for auto-approval
    chunk_size: int = 1000            # Processing chunk size
    cache_size: int = 1000            # LRU cache size
```

### Method 2: Update File Paths
Simply update the file paths in the configuration:

```python
bank_statement_file: str = r"C:\path\to\your\bank_statement.csv"
rules_file: str = r"C:\path\to\your\rules.csv"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python fuzzy_logic_improved.py
```

### What Happens During Execution

1. **Loading**: Reads your bank statement and rules files
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans transaction descriptions for better matching
3. **Matching**: Uses fuzzy logic to find best category matches
4. **Scoring**: Assigns confidence scores to each match
5. **Suggestions**: Provides alternative categories for unmatched transactions
6. **Output**: Saves results to CSV with detailed categorization data

## Understanding the Output

The generated CSV file contains these additional columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Category` | Assigned category or "Uncategorised" |
| `Match_Score` | Confidence score (0-100) |
| `Matched_Rule` | The rule pattern that matched |
| `Auto_Approved` | Whether match was auto-approved |
| `Suggestion_1` | First alternative category |
| `Suggestion_2` | Second alternative category |
| `Suggestion_3` | Third alternative category |

### Example Output
```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Category,Match_Score,Auto_Approved,Suggestion_1
2024-01-01,TESCO STORE 1234,25.50,Groceries,95.0,true,
2024-01-02,UNKNOWN MERCHANT,30.00,Uncategorised,45.0,false,Shopping (60%)
```

## Configuration Parameters Explained

### `match_threshold` (Default: 70)
- Minimum score required for automatic categorization
- Higher values = more strict matching
- Lower values = more lenient matching

### `auto_approve_threshold` (Default: 80)
- Score threshold for automatic approval without manual review
- Transactions above this score are marked as `Auto_Approved: true`

### `num_suggestions` (Default: 3)
- Number of alternative category suggestions for unmatched transactions
- Helps with manual categorization of difficult cases

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Create Comprehensive Rules
```csv
Description,Category
tesco,Groceries
sainsbury,Groceries
shell,Transport
bp,Transport
exxon,Transport
amazon,Shopping
ebay,Shopping
```

### 2. Use Broad Patterns
Instead of exact matches, use key identifying words:
- ‚úÖ "shell" matches "SHELL PETROL STATION 1234"
- ‚ùå "shell petrol station 1234" only matches exact text

### 3. Handle Common Variations
```csv
Description,Category
mcdonalds,Food & Drink
mcdonald,Food & Drink
mcd,Food & Drink
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance
- Review uncategorized transactions periodically
- Add new rules based on unmatched patterns
- Update existing rules for better coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**File Not Found Error**
```
FileNotFoundError: Rules file not found
```
- Check file paths in the configuration
- Ensure files exist in the specified locations
- Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work

**Empty Results**
```
ValueError: Rules file is empty
```
- Verify your rules.csv has content
- Check for proper CSV formatting
- Ensure Description and Category columns exist

**Low Match Rates**
- Lower the `match_threshold` value
- Review and expand your rules file
- Check transaction description patterns

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce `cache_size` if memory is limited
- Increase `chunk_size` for large datasets
- Consider breaking large files into smaller batches

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging by checking the generated `categoriser.log` file:
```
2024-01-01 10:00:00 - INFO - Loading rules from rules.csv
2024-01-01 10:00:01 - INFO - Successfully loaded 150 rules
2024-01-01 10:00:02 - INFO - Processing 1000 transactions
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Cleaning Functions
The tool includes advanced text preprocessing:
- Removes common financial terms (ref, payment, purchase)
- Strips card numbers and reference codes
- Normalizes spacing and capitalization

### Scoring Algorithm
Uses a hybrid approach:
- 60% Token Set Ratio (handles word order variations)
- 40% Partial Ratio (finds substring matches)

## Performance Benchmarks

Typical performance on a standard laptop:
- **Small datasets** (< 1,000 transactions): < 5 seconds
- **Medium datasets** (1,000 - 10,000 transactions): 10-30 seconds
- **Large datasets** (> 10,000 transactions): 1-5 minutes

## Contributing
